# SimpleScreenSnip
A screenshot tool that floats above all windows with double click saving and window transparency settings. 
Good tool for fast serial snipping.

1) Click plus to snip screen. This will freeze the screen at the time it is pressed.

2) Make selection by clicking ( left button ) at the frozen screen at desired point. You don't have to drag, 
just click corners of your preferred portion of frozen screen.

3) To make a reselection, single click with your correction. This will automatically discard existing shaded selection 
rectangle.

4) When done selecting, double click at the selection rectangle. Your snipped window will appear your last position of 
your mouse pointer.

5) To abort selection, press ESC or right click.

6) Right clicking will close any snipped window WITHOUT PROMPTING.

7) All windows created with this tool will float above all windows. Make completely transparent with slider or press 
"A" button of snipped window in order to disable mouse hittesting.

8) Double clicking will open save file dialog if "S" button of main window is not checked. If a name is specified at
the textbox field of snipped window, file will be saved instantly with .png format even if file exists WITHOUT PROMPTING.

9) You can open any image as snipped window visual or group of images by simply drag-drop to any of the tools window.

10) "S" button wil serialize naming of snipped window. A good practice is saving first screenshot with preferred folder
with name of "1", "01", "001" etc without any other characters. Then since this folder will be remembered, 
checking "S" button will make tool give next name iteration of next snipped window. Naming is made only with numbers, 
this will automatically sort the screenshots. Pressing 0 in front of numbers determines number of digits contained
in the name.

11) Undo is not supported.
